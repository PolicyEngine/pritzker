    "markdown": "### A. Deficit in FY2025 (-$61,469)\n\nThe deficit in FY2025 was planned and budgeted. After achieving surpluses in FY2023 ($364,486 change in net assets) and FY2024 ($133,541), PSL Foundation built net assets to $619,507 by June 2023. The FY2025 deficit reflects deployment of these accumulated reserves to scale operations while revenue reached $1,000,160.\n\n### B. Significant Expense Fluctuations\n\n**FY2023 to FY2024 (from $6,875 to $779,576):**\n\nThe dramatic increase reflects the transition from formation to full operations. In FY2023, software development was capitalized as an asset ($233,881) rather than expensed. FY2024 included amortization expense ($61,358) and the first full year of program operations for both PolicyEngine and QuantEcon.\n\n**FY2024 to FY2025 (from $779,576 to $1,061,629, +36%):**\n\nKey increases include:\n- Contractor payments (USD): +$48,151\n- Contractor payments - AUD: +$103,962 (QuantEcon program)\n- Software expenses: +$40,306\n- Office supplies & software: +$21,826\n- Operating expenses - Payroll: +$25,081 (new staff capacity)\n- Other business expenses: +$30,167\n- Legal & professional services: +$5,954\n\n### C. Significant Revenue Fluctuations\n\n**FY2023 to FY2024 (from $371,361 to $913,116, +146%):**\n\nFY2023 included initial contributions ($347,041) with $252,540 restricted for QuantEcon program. FY2024 showed diversified revenue including contributions ($533,095), non-profit revenue ($379,951), and grant income.\n\n**FY2024 to FY2025 (from $913,116 to $1,000,160, +9.5%):**\n\nRevenue stabilized with grants/contracts, contributions ($435,551), and non-profit revenue ($564,609) supporting both PolicyEngine and QuantEcon programs.\n\n### D. Overall Operational Health\n\nPSL Foundation demonstrates healthy financial position:\n\n1. **Strong reserves**: Net assets of $619,507 as of June 2023 provide operating buffer\n2. **Planned deficit**: The FY2025 deficit was budgeted (-$61,469 actual vs -$60,000 budgeted)\n3. **Revenue growth**: Steady growth to sustainable $1M level\n4. **Mission-aligned spending**: PSL Foundation supports both PolicyEngine (accessible policy analysis) and QuantEcon (economic modeling education) programs\n\nThe financial trajectory shows successful formation (FY2023), operational launch with surplus (FY2024), and strategic investment in growth (FY2025).\n",

PolicyEngine makes this capability freely available to advocacy organizations, state agencies, and community groups, leveling the information playing field for policy debates.\n\n**Enabling State-Level Action:**\nWith all 50 states modeled, state legislators and governors can analyze how federal policy changes would affect their specific state, and design complementary state-level interventions optimized for their populations.\n\n**Accelerating Evidence-Based Policymaking:**\nInstead of waiting months for commissioned analysis, policymakers can instantly model policy alternatives, understanding trade-offs between different design choices (e.g., age targeting vs. universal benefits, refundability structures, interaction effects with existing programs).\n\n**Supporting Cross-State Learning:**\nBy providing comparable analysis across all states, the project enables movement actors to identify successful state innovations and build support for scaling effective policies.\n\n**Measurable Outcomes:**\n- Dashboard operational by April 2026 with prenatal-to-age-3 modeling capabilities\n- All 50 states' TANF and CCDF rules implemented by October 2026\n- Leaders from 30+ states trained on PolicyEngine tools by October 2026\n- National PN-3 partners (Niskanen Center, PN-3 Policy Impact Center) using PolicyEngine for analysis and advocacy\n\nThrough these capabilities, the project enables the movement building necessary to achieve universal access to PN-3 supports and resources by 2027.\n",
    "plainText": "Purpose:\n\nThis project expands PolicyEngine's analytical capabilities to comprehensively model family economic security policies affecting prenatal-to-age-3 children across all 50 states. The expansion focuses on three core deliverables:\nChild Poverty Impact Dashboard - A specialized analytical interface enabling users to model and compare policy reforms including:\nChild Tax Credit (CTC) variations by amount, age eligibility (prenatal-3, 0-5, 0-17), income basis, and phaseout structure\nEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC) reforms including individualization and expansion options\nDependent exemptions, universal basic income, and SNAP modifications\nState-specific policy levers and new state-level CTCs\nResults displaying fiscal costs, child poverty impacts (overall and ages 0-3), and distributional effects\nComprehensive State Program Modeling - Full implementation of TANF and Child Care and Development Fund eligibility and benefit calculation rules for all 50 states, enabling complete nationwide policy analysis with programmatic representation of each state's unique rules.\nTraining and Expert Consultation - Webinars, training sessions, and analytical support for national PN-3 partners and state leaders, with participation from leaders in at least 30 states.\n\nIntended Impact:\n\nThe project will transform how stakeholders analyze policies affecting young children and families by:\n\nDemocratizing Policy Analysis:\nCurrently, sophisticated microsimulation modeling is accessible primarily to well-resourced research institutions. PolicyEngine makes this capability freely available to advocacy organizations, state agencies, and community groups, leveling the information playing field for policy debates.\n\nEnabling State-Level Action:\nWith all 50 states modeled, state legislators and governors can analyze how federal policy changes would affect their specific state, and design complementary state-level interventions optimized for their populations.\n\nAccelerating Evidence-Based Policymaking:\nInstead of waiting months for commissioned analysis, policymakers can instantly model policy alternatives, understanding trade-offs between different design choices (e.g., age targeting vs. universal benefits, refundability structures, interaction effects with existing programs).\n\nSupporting Cross-State Learning:\nBy providing comparable analysis across all states, the project enables movement actors to identify successful state innovations and build support for scaling effective policies.\n\nMeasurable Outcomes:\nDashboard operational by April 2026 with prenatal-to-age-3 modeling capabilities\nAll 50 states' TANF and CCDF rules implemented by October 2026\nLeaders from 30+ states trained on PolicyEngine tools by October 2026\nNational PN-3 partners (Niskanen Center, PN-3 Policy Impact Center) using PolicyEngine for analysis and advocacy\n\nThrough these capabilities, the project enables the movement building necessary to achieve universal access to PN-3 supports and resources by 2027.",
