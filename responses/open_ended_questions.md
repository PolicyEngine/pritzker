# Open-Ended Questions

## Representation

**Question:** How is your organization representative of or connected to the communities you serve?

**Response:**

PolicyEngine serves policymakers, researchers, advocates, and families seeking to understand how public policies affect household finances and child well-being. The organization maintains connection to these communities through:

**User-Centered Design:**
PolicyEngine's platform development responds directly to user needs identified through:
- Feedback from advocacy organizations working with historically underinvested communities
- Requests from state-level policymakers seeking to understand impacts on their constituents
- Input from researchers studying family economic security policies

**Accessibility Focus:**
The organization's core mission centers on democratizing policy analysis that has traditionally been available only to well-resourced institutions. By providing free, open-source tools, PolicyEngine removes barriers that prevent community-based organizations and grassroots advocates from accessing rigorous analysis.

**Policy Focus Areas:**
PolicyEngine's modeling capabilities concentrate on programs that directly affect families with young children and low-to-moderate income households - including Child Tax Credits, EITC, TANF, SNAP, and child care subsidies. This focus aligns with the needs of communities most affected by these policies.

- Advisory structures incorporating voices with lived experience]

## Commitment

**Question:** What current efforts and initiatives of your organization reflect your commitment to the communities that you serve or represent?

**Response:**

**Free and Open Access:**
PolicyEngine operates all tools free of charge with no paywalls or usage restrictions, ensuring advocates in under-resourced communities can access the same analytical capabilities as well-funded organizations.

**Open-Source Transparency:**
The organization's complete codebase is publicly available under an open-source license (AGPL-3.0), enabling community review, contribution, and verification of analysis methods. This transparency builds trust and enables advocates to confidently cite PolicyEngine analysis in policy debates.

**Training and Technical Assistance:**
Through this project, PolicyEngine will conduct training specifically designed to reach state-level advocates and policymakers in at least 30 states, with focus on ensuring leaders can independently conduct analysis without ongoing technical support requirements.

**User-Friendly Design:**
PolicyEngine prioritizes accessible interface design that does not require technical or econometric expertise, recognizing that effective advocates and policymakers come from diverse backgrounds and may not have quantitative training.

**Rapid Responsiveness:**
PolicyEngine's nimble structure enables quick responses to emerging policy debates, allowing advocates to access timely analysis when policy windows open unexpectedly.

**Focus on Prenatal-to-Age-3 Outcomes:**
This project specifically expands capabilities to model impacts on the youngest children, reflecting commitment to supporting policy advocacy that centers the needs of families with infants and toddlers - a population often underrepresented in policy analysis.

[NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED IF APPLICABLE - Additional initiatives such as:
- Pro bono analysis for specific advocacy campaigns
- Partnerships with state or community organizations
- Specific efforts to reach historically marginalized communities
- Language accessibility initiatives]

## Lived Experience

**Question:** If not included in your responses above, how is your organization informed by the perspectives of those with lived experience in its work?

**Response:**

[NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED - Describe how PolicyEngine incorporates perspectives of people with lived experience of poverty, use of safety net programs, or raising young children, through:
- Advisory boards or councils
- User testing and feedback processes
- Partnerships with organizations led by people with lived experience
- Staff composition
- Community engagement processes
- Other mechanisms for centering lived experience in tool design and deployment]

PolicyEngine's work is informed by the priorities and questions raised by advocacy organizations that work directly with families affected by tax and benefit policies. The platform's feature development responds to real-world needs identified by practitioners working in communities, ensuring analysis capabilities align with the questions families and advocates need answered to support policy change.

However, more formal structures for incorporating lived experience perspectives could strengthen the organization's work. [IF APPLICABLE: Describe any plans to develop such structures or partnerships.]

Note: This section should honestly describe current practices while acknowledging areas for growth, as appropriate.
