# Sustainability & Future Impact

**Question:** If your organization will scale the project or continue it beyond the time period in the grant, please describe how it intends to do so and intended future impact.

**Response:**

**Sustainability Beyond Grant Period:**

Once developed, the Child Poverty Impact Dashboard and state-level TANF/CCDF modeling capabilities become permanent features of PolicyEngine's platform, requiring only maintenance and updates rather than ongoing development investment. This infrastructure will continue serving users indefinitely.

**Ongoing Operations:**
PolicyEngine's operational model supports long-term sustainability through:
- Open-source architecture reducing vendor lock-in and enabling community contributions to rules maintenance
- PSL Foundation's fiscal sponsorship providing administrative infrastructure
- Diversified funding from multiple foundations and research partnerships
- Growing user base creating demand for continued platform operation

**Scaling Impact:**
Beyond 2026, PolicyEngine intends to:

**Expand State-Level Modeling:**
Build on TANF and CCDF implementation to add additional state programs (e.g., state EITCs, state child tax credits, housing assistance programs), providing increasingly comprehensive state policy analysis.

**Deepen Microsimulation Capabilities:**
While initial state program implementation focuses on programmatic rules representation, subsequent work can add microsimulation calibration for enhanced accuracy, building on the rules infrastructure created through this grant.

**Broaden User Base:**
With comprehensive 50-state modeling operational, PolicyEngine can expand training and outreach to legislative fiscal offices, governor's policy staff, and state-level advocacy organizations, multiplying the platform's impact on evidence-based policymaking.

**Support Policy Implementation:**
As states adopt new PN-3 policies informed by PolicyEngine analysis, the platform can support implementation monitoring and evaluation, helping states track actual outcomes against projections.

**Intended Future Impact:**
By 2030 and beyond, PolicyEngine envisions:
- Standard use of the platform by state legislative fiscal offices for analyzing family economic security policies
- Regular use by advocacy organizations in all 50 states for building support for PN-3 investments
- Integration of PolicyEngine analysis into policy debates at federal and state levels
- Measurable policy improvements (expanded CTCs, improved TANF provisions, increased child care subsidies) informed by accessible analysis

The infrastructure created through this grant will serve as a foundation for PolicyEngine's long-term mission of making policy analysis accessible and rigorous, ultimately contributing to better outcomes for children and families through improved policymaking.
