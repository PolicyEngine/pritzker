PolicyEngine serves policymakers, researchers, advocates, and families seeking to understand how public policies affect household finances and child well-being. The organization maintains connection to these communities through:

**User-Centered Design:**
PolicyEngine's platform development responds directly to user needs identified through:
- Feedback from advocacy organizations working with historically underinvested communities
- Requests from state-level policymakers seeking to understand impacts on their constituents
- Input from researchers studying family economic security policies

**Accessibility Focus:**
The organization's core mission centers on democratizing policy analysis that has traditionally been available only to well-resourced institutions. By providing free, open-source tools, PolicyEngine removes barriers that prevent community-based organizations and grassroots advocates from accessing rigorous analysis.

**Policy Focus Areas:**
PolicyEngine's modeling capabilities concentrate on programs that directly affect families with young children and low-to-moderate income households - including Child Tax Credits, EITC, TANF, SNAP, and child care subsidies. This focus aligns with the needs of communities most affected by these policies.
