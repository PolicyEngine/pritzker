# Lived Experience

**Question:** If not included in your responses above, how is your organization informed by the perspectives of those with lived experience in its work?

**Response:**

[NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED - Describe how PolicyEngine incorporates perspectives of people with lived experience of poverty, use of safety net programs, or raising young children, through:
- Advisory boards or councils
- User testing and feedback processes
- Partnerships with organizations led by people with lived experience
- Staff composition
- Community engagement processes
- Other mechanisms for centering lived experience in tool design and deployment]

PolicyEngine's work is informed by the priorities and questions raised by advocacy organizations that work directly with families affected by tax and benefit policies. The platform's feature development responds to real-world needs identified by practitioners working in communities, ensuring analysis capabilities align with the questions families and advocates need answered to support policy change.

However, more formal structures for incorporating lived experience perspectives could strengthen the organization's work. [IF APPLICABLE: Describe any plans to develop such structures or partnerships.]

Note: This section should honestly describe current practices while acknowledging areas for growth, as appropriate.
