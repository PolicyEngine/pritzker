# Project Detail

## Alignment With Goal

**Question:** How does the proposed project align with and advance the goal of this focus area?

**Response:**

This project directly advances the Pritzker Children's Initiative's Movement Building strategy by providing the analytical infrastructure necessary for advocates, policymakers, and researchers to make evidence-based decisions about prenatal-to-age-3 investments.

The project aligns with PCI's North Star goals through:

**Supporting Universal Access to PN-3 Supports (2027 Goal):**
By enabling all 50 states to model family economic security policies, this project ensures that every state and community can access rigorous analysis of PN-3 policy investments, supporting the goal that 100% of families with children live in states where significant new public resources have been invested in PN-3 supports.

**Connecting Families to Resources (2027 Goal):**
PolicyEngine's modeling capabilities will help policymakers understand which policy designs most effectively reach historically underinvested communities, supporting PCI-funded states in connecting PN-3 families to resources they want and need.

**Movement Building Impact:**
The stated grantee impact - "Provide cost and impact modeling of family economic security policies across all 50 states, leading to better informed decision making" - directly enables advocates and policymakers to build support for PN-3 investments through accessible, data-driven analysis.

PolicyEngine serves as infrastructure for the movement, empowering partners like the Niskanen Center and PN-3 Policy Impact Center with tools to analyze Child Tax Credit expansions, EITC reforms, SNAP enhancements, TANF modifications, and child care subsidies - all critical policies affecting prenatal-to-age-3 outcomes.

## Project Narrative

**Question:** Describe the purpose and intended impact of this project.

**Response:**

**Purpose:**

This project expands PolicyEngine's analytical capabilities to comprehensively model family economic security policies affecting prenatal-to-age-3 children across all 50 states. The expansion focuses on three core deliverables:

1. **Child Poverty Impact Dashboard** - A specialized analytical interface enabling users to model and compare policy reforms including:
   - Child Tax Credit (CTC) variations by amount, age eligibility (prenatal-3, 0-5, 0-17), income basis, and phaseout structure
   - Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) reforms including individualization and expansion options
   - Dependent exemptions, universal basic income, and SNAP modifications
   - State-specific policy levers and new state-level CTCs
   - Results displaying fiscal costs, child poverty impacts (overall and ages 0-3), and distributional effects

2. **Comprehensive State Program Modeling** - Full implementation of TANF and Child Care and Development Fund eligibility and benefit calculation rules for all 50 states, enabling complete nationwide policy analysis with programmatic representation of each state's unique rules.

3. **Training and Expert Consultation** - Webinars, training sessions, and analytical support for national PN-3 partners and state leaders, with participation from leaders in at least 30 states.

**Intended Impact:**

The project will transform how stakeholders analyze policies affecting young children and families by:

**Democratizing Policy Analysis:**
Currently, sophisticated microsimulation modeling is accessible primarily to well-resourced research institutions. PolicyEngine makes this capability freely available to advocacy organizations, state agencies, and community groups, leveling the information playing field for policy debates.

**Enabling State-Level Action:**
With all 50 states modeled, state legislators and governors can analyze how federal policy changes would affect their specific state, and design complementary state-level interventions optimized for their populations.

**Accelerating Evidence-Based Policymaking:**
Instead of waiting months for commissioned analysis, policymakers can instantly model policy alternatives, understanding trade-offs between different design choices (e.g., age targeting vs. universal benefits, refundability structures, interaction effects with existing programs).

**Supporting Cross-State Learning:**
By providing comparable analysis across all states, the project enables movement actors to identify successful state innovations and build support for scaling effective policies.

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Dashboard operational by April 2026 with prenatal-to-age-3 modeling capabilities
- All 50 states' TANF and CCDF rules implemented by October 2026
- Leaders from 30+ states trained on PolicyEngine tools by October 2026
- National PN-3 partners (Niskanen Center, PN-3 Policy Impact Center) using PolicyEngine for analysis and advocacy

Through these capabilities, the project enables the movement building necessary to achieve universal access to PN-3 supports and resources by 2027.

## Capacity & Fit

**Question:** Briefly describe your organization's history as it relates to this project and how this makes your organization uniquely capable of implementing this project and ensuring its success.

**Response:**

PolicyEngine possesses unique technical and operational capabilities that position it to deliver this expansion successfully:

**Proven Technical Platform:**
PolicyEngine currently operates a production web application (policyengine.org) serving policymakers, researchers, and advocates with federal tax and benefit policy analysis. The platform demonstrates technical feasibility and scalability, having successfully modeled complex interactions across multiple federal programs.

**Open-Source Development Model:**
PolicyEngine's codebase is fully open-source (AGPL-3.0 license) and available at github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-app. This transparency ensures reproducibility of analysis and enables community contribution to rules implementation, critical for maintaining accuracy across 50 state programs.

**Rules Engine Architecture:**
PolicyEngine has developed a sophisticated rules engine capable of programmatically representing policy logic. This existing infrastructure can be extended to encompass state-level TANF and CCDF programs without requiring fundamental architectural changes.

**Partnership with Research Community:**
Operating under PSL Foundation's fiscal sponsorship connects PolicyEngine to the Policy Simulation Library ecosystem, which includes established microsimulation projects and academic researchers who contribute to rules validation.

**Track Record with Child Poverty Analysis:**
PolicyEngine has demonstrated capability in modeling child poverty impacts through existing CTC and EITC analysis features. The proposed dashboard builds on proven functionality rather than developing entirely new capabilities.

**Training and Support Experience:**
[NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED IF APPLICABLE - Any previous webinars, training sessions, or technical assistance PolicyEngine has provided]

**Technical Team:**
PolicyEngine's development team brings expertise in:
- Web application development (JavaScript/TypeScript, React)
