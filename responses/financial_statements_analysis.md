### D. Overall Operational Health

PSL Foundation demonstrates healthy financial position:

1. **Strong reserves**: Net assets of $619,507 as of June 2023 provide operating buffer
2. **Planned deficit**: The FY2025 deficit was budgeted (-$61,469 actual vs -$60,000 budgeted)
3. **Revenue growth**: Steady growth to sustainable $1M level
4. **Mission-aligned spending**: PSL Foundation supports both PolicyEngine (accessible policy analysis) and QuantEcon (economic modeling education) programs

The financial trajectory shows successful formation (FY2023), operational launch with surplus (FY2024), and strategic investment in growth (FY2025).
