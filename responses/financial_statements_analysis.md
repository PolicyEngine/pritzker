# Questions from Audited Financials

## Question

In the period in which you or your fiscal sponsor provided financial statements, to what do you attribute:

- A deficit in any year,
- Any significant fluctuation in expenses between years,
- Any significant fluctuation in revenues between years, and
- Any other significant change in your operational health as indicated in your audited financial statements?

## Response

### A. Deficit in FY2025 (-$61,469)

The deficit in FY2025 was planned and budgeted. After achieving surpluses in FY2023 ($364,486 change in net assets) and FY2024 ($133,541), PSL Foundation built net assets to $619,507 by June 2023. The FY2025 deficit reflects deployment of these accumulated reserves to scale operations while revenue reached $1,000,160.

### B. Significant Expense Fluctuations

**FY2023 to FY2024 (from $6,875 to $779,576):**

The dramatic increase reflects the transition from formation to full operations. In FY2023, software development was capitalized as an asset ($233,881) rather than expensed. FY2024 included amortization expense ($61,358) and the first full year of program operations for both PolicyEngine and QuantEcon.

**FY2024 to FY2025 (from $779,576 to $1,061,629, +36%):**

Key increases include:
- Contractor payments (USD): +$48,151
- Contractor payments - AUD: +$103,962 (QuantEcon program)
- Software expenses: +$40,306
- Office supplies & software: +$21,826
- Operating expenses - Payroll: +$25,081 (new staff capacity)
- Other business expenses: +$30,167
- Legal & professional services: +$5,954

### C. Significant Revenue Fluctuations

**FY2023 to FY2024 (from $371,361 to $913,116, +146%):**

FY2023 included initial contributions ($347,041) with $252,540 restricted for QuantEcon program. FY2024 showed diversified revenue including contributions ($533,095), non-profit revenue ($379,951), and grant income.

**FY2024 to FY2025 (from $913,116 to $1,000,160, +9.5%):**

Revenue stabilized with grants/contracts, contributions ($435,551), and non-profit revenue ($564,609) supporting both PolicyEngine and QuantEcon programs.

### D. Overall Operational Health

PSL Foundation demonstrates healthy financial position:

1. **Strong reserves**: Net assets of $619,507 as of June 2023 provide operating buffer
2. **Planned deficit**: The FY2025 deficit was budgeted (-$61,469 actual vs -$60,000 budgeted)
3. **Revenue growth**: Steady growth to sustainable $1M level
4. **Mission-aligned spending**: PSL Foundation supports both PolicyEngine (accessible policy analysis) and QuantEcon (economic modeling education) programs

The financial trajectory shows successful formation (FY2023), operational launch with surplus (FY2024), and strategic investment in growth (FY2025).
