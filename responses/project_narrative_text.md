**Purpose:**

This project expands PolicyEngine's analytical capabilities to comprehensively model family economic security policies affecting prenatal-to-age-3 children across all 50 states. The expansion focuses on three core deliverables:

1. **Child Poverty Impact Dashboard** - A specialized analytical interface enabling users to model and compare policy reforms including:
   - Child Tax Credit (CTC) variations by amount, age eligibility (prenatal-3, 0-5, 0-17), income basis, and phaseout structure
   - Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) reforms including individualization and expansion options
   - Dependent exemptions, universal basic income, and SNAP modifications
   - State-specific policy levers and new state-level CTCs
   - Results displaying fiscal costs, child poverty impacts (overall and ages 0-3), and distributional effects

2. **Comprehensive State Program Modeling** - Full implementation of TANF and Child Care and Development Fund eligibility and benefit calculation rules for all 50 states, enabling complete nationwide policy analysis with programmatic representation of each state's unique rules.

3. **Training and Expert Consultation** - Webinars, training sessions, and analytical support for national PN-3 partners and state leaders, with participation from leaders in at least 30 states.

**Intended Impact:**

The project will transform how stakeholders analyze policies affecting young children and families by:

**Democratizing Policy Analysis:**
Currently, sophisticated microsimulation modeling is accessible primarily to well-resourced research institutions. PolicyEngine makes this capability freely available to advocacy organizations, state agencies, and community groups, leveling the information playing field for policy debates.

**Enabling State-Level Action:**
With all 50 states modeled, state legislators and governors can analyze how federal policy changes would affect their specific state, and design complementary state-level interventions optimized for their populations.

**Accelerating Evidence-Based Policymaking:**
Instead of waiting months for commissioned analysis, policymakers can instantly model policy alternatives, understanding trade-offs between different design choices (e.g., age targeting vs. universal benefits, refundability structures, interaction effects with existing programs).

**Supporting Cross-State Learning:**
By providing comparable analysis across all states, the project enables movement actors to identify successful state innovations and build support for scaling effective policies.

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- Dashboard operational by April 2026 with prenatal-to-age-3 modeling capabilities
- All 50 states' TANF and CCDF rules implemented by October 2026
- Leaders from 30+ states trained on PolicyEngine tools by October 2026
- National PN-3 partners (Niskanen Center, PN-3 Policy Impact Center) using PolicyEngine for analysis and advocacy

Through these capabilities, the project enables the movement building necessary to achieve universal access to PN-3 supports and resources by 2027.
