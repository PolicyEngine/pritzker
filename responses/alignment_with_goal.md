# Alignment With Goal

**Question:** How does the proposed project align with and advance the goal of this focus area?

**Response:**

This project directly advances the Pritzker Children's Initiative's Movement Building strategy by providing the analytical infrastructure necessary for advocates, policymakers, and researchers to make evidence-based decisions about prenatal-to-age-3 investments.

The project aligns with PCI's North Star goals through:

**Supporting Universal Access to PN-3 Supports (2027 Goal):**
By enabling all 50 states to model family economic security policies, this project ensures that every state and community can access rigorous analysis of PN-3 policy investments, supporting the goal that 100% of families with children live in states where significant new public resources have been invested in PN-3 supports.

**Connecting Families to Resources (2027 Goal):**
PolicyEngine's modeling capabilities will help policymakers understand which policy designs most effectively reach historically underinvested communities, supporting PCI-funded states in connecting PN-3 families to resources they want and need.

**Movement Building Impact:**
The stated grantee impact - "Provide cost and impact modeling of family economic security policies across all 50 states, leading to better informed decision making" - directly enables advocates and policymakers to build support for PN-3 investments through accessible, data-driven analysis.

PolicyEngine serves as infrastructure for the movement, empowering partners like the Niskanen Center and PN-3 Policy Impact Center with tools to analyze Child Tax Credit expansions, EITC reforms, SNAP enhancements, TANF modifications, and child care subsidies - all critical policies affecting prenatal-to-age-3 outcomes.
