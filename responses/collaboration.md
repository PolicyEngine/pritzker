This project centers on PolicyEngine's technical development work, with collaboration through training and consultation partnerships:

**National PN-3 Partners:**
- **Niskanen Center:** PolicyEngine will provide training sessions and analytical support, enabling Niskanen to use the expanded tools for their advocacy work on family economic security policies.
- **PN-3 Policy Impact Center:** PolicyEngine will deliver specialized training on child poverty analysis capabilities, supporting the Policy Impact Center's work analyzing PN-3 investments.

**State-Level Engagement:**
PolicyEngine will conduct webinars reaching leaders in at least 30 states, providing training on using the Child Poverty Impact Dashboard and state-specific modeling capabilities. This training will enable state advocates and policymakers to independently conduct analysis relevant to their local contexts.

**Collaboration Model:**
PolicyEngine maintains responsibility for:
- All technical development and platform maintenance
- Rules implementation accuracy across all 50 states
- Dashboard design and functionality
- Training content development and delivery

Partner organizations receive:
- Training on PolicyEngine tools
- Analytical support for using the platform
- Access to expertise for interpreting results

**No Subgrants:**
This proposal does not involve subgrants. All funding will support PolicyEngine's direct work on technical development, rules implementation, and training delivery.
