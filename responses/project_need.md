Policymakers, researchers, and advocates lack accessible tools to rigorously analyze how tax and benefit policies affect child poverty and family economic security. Understanding the specific impacts of policy variations across different states and family circumstances requires sophisticated modeling that is typically inaccessible to most stakeholders. With substantial state-level variation in policies affecting families with young children - including state earned income tax credits, child tax credits, SNAP supplements, TANF benefits, and child care subsidies - decision-makers need tools to understand how federal and state policies interact to affect outcomes in their specific jurisdictions.

Current gaps in policy analysis infrastructure include:
- Limited ability to model state-specific TANF and child care subsidy programs alongside federal policies
- Insufficient tools for analyzing prenatal-to-age-3 child poverty impacts specifically
- Lack of accessible platforms for comparing policy alternatives and understanding state-level variation across all 50 states
- Barriers preventing state-level advocates and policymakers from conducting independent analysis of how state tax credits and benefit programs complement federal policies

This project addresses these gaps by expanding PolicyEngine's free, open-source platform to provide comprehensive modeling of family economic security policies with specific focus on prenatal-to-age-3 outcomes. The expansion aligns with the Pritzker Children's Initiative's North Star goal of ensuring every child is thriving and flourishing by age three, and every family has access to resources to help their children thrive.

By 2027, this work will enable 100% of families with children in the US to live in states where decision-makers can access rigorous, accessible analysis of PN-3 policy investments, leading to better-informed decisions about public resource allocation.
