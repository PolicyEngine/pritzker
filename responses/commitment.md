**Free and Open Access:**
PolicyEngine operates all tools free of charge with no paywalls or usage restrictions, ensuring advocates in under-resourced communities can access the same analytical capabilities as well-funded organizations.

**Open-Source Transparency:**
The organization's complete codebase is publicly available under an open-source license (AGPL-3.0), enabling community review, contribution, and verification of analysis methods. This transparency builds trust and enables advocates to confidently cite PolicyEngine analysis in policy debates.

**Training and Technical Assistance:**
Through this project, PolicyEngine will conduct training specifically designed to reach state-level advocates and policymakers in at least 30 states, with focus on ensuring leaders can independently conduct analysis without ongoing technical support requirements.

**User-Friendly Design:**
PolicyEngine prioritizes accessible interface design that does not require technical or econometric expertise, recognizing that effective advocates and policymakers come from diverse backgrounds and may not have quantitative training.

**Rapid Responsiveness:**
PolicyEngine's nimble structure enables quick responses to emerging policy debates, allowing advocates to access timely analysis when policy windows open unexpectedly.

**Focus on Prenatal-to-Age-3 Outcomes:**
This project specifically expands capabilities to model impacts on the youngest children, reflecting commitment to supporting policy advocacy that centers the needs of families with infants and toddlers - a population often underrepresented in policy analysis.
