This project will expand PolicyEngine's policy analysis capabilities to model child poverty impacts and family economic security policies across all 50 states, enabling data-driven decision-making on prenatal-to-age-3 investments. PolicyEngine will deliver a Child Poverty Impact Dashboard, comprehensive state-level TANF and child care subsidy modeling, and training to national and state partners to support evidence-based policymaking.
