PolicyEngine possesses unique technical and operational capabilities that position it to deliver this expansion successfully:

**Proven Technical Platform:**
PolicyEngine currently operates a production web application (policyengine.org) serving policymakers, researchers, and advocates with federal tax and benefit policy analysis. The platform demonstrates technical feasibility and scalability, having successfully modeled complex interactions across multiple federal programs.

**Open-Source Development Model:**
PolicyEngine's codebase is fully open-source (AGPL-3.0 license) and available at github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-app. This transparency ensures reproducibility of analysis and enables community contribution to rules implementation, critical for maintaining accuracy across 50 state programs.

**Rules Engine Architecture:**
PolicyEngine has developed a sophisticated rules engine capable of programmatically representing policy logic. This existing infrastructure can be extended to encompass state-level TANF and CCDF programs without requiring fundamental architectural changes.

**Partnership with Research Community:**
Operating under PSL Foundation's fiscal sponsorship connects PolicyEngine to the Policy Simulation Library ecosystem, which includes established microsimulation projects and academic researchers who contribute to rules validation.

**Track Record with Child Poverty Analysis:**
PolicyEngine has demonstrated capability in modeling child poverty impacts through existing CTC and EITC analysis features. The proposed dashboard builds on proven functionality rather than developing entirely new capabilities.

**Training and Support Experience:**
PolicyEngine has conducted dozens of webinars and training sessions, with recordings available at youtube.com/policyengine. This experience demonstrates the organization's capability to deliver effective training to national and state partners.

**Technical Team:**
PolicyEngine's development team brings expertise in:
- Web application development (JavaScript/TypeScript, React)
- Tax and benefit policy modeling
- Open-source software development practices
- Data visualization for policy analysis

**Unique Positioning:**
PolicyEngine is uniquely positioned because it combines:
1. Technical capability to build and maintain sophisticated policy modeling infrastructure
2. Commitment to accessibility through free, open-source tools
3. Focus specifically on practical tools for advocacy and policymaking (not just academic research)
4. Nimble nonprofit structure enabling rapid iteration based on user needs

No comparable platform offers free, open-source, comprehensive state-and-federal policy modeling accessible to non-technical users.
